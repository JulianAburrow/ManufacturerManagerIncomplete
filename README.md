# ManufacturerManagerWithMudBlazorIncomplete
The developer responsible for this mission critical application has disappeared without trace and the application MUST be completed!
Most of it is done and all the clues as to how to complete it are in what is already there.
Good luck! (By the way this was due to go live next week and the business are screaming for it...)

# Setup
You will need to run the ManufacturerManagerWithMudBlazor_Db_Script.sql script against a SQL Server and then change the connection string in appsettings.json to the appropriate server in order to run this application.

# Purpose
This is intended as a training application - it is possible for someone with no Blazor knowledge to complete this by looking at what is already there. By the time they have finished they should have a good idea of what a Blazor application with MudBlazor looks like and how it works.
It is NOT intended to teach how Blazor works or how to set up Blazor / MudBlazor. There is plenty of information on the internet to do that. This is a practical application of the information out there.
